# Workshop: From DDD/BDD to Outside-in TDD

This repo is part of the Xebia Tactical DDD Workshop. 

We have prepared two tracks for you:
- **Lab1Begin**: contains basic scaffolding that you can use to **implement your own domaim model**
- **Lab1Begin-XebiaModel**: besides the scaffolding we have **already built part of the domain model** for you. We have deliberately left out some of parts of the implementation and it is up to you to make sure that the domain model works and the tests pass :-).

Use `git checkout` to switch the branch of your choice. We have **not** removed the Git history. Refrain from 'peaking' if you can :-).
